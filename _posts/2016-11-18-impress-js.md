I recently stumbled across [Impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js) and I have to say... **Wow**. This is such a great project. If you really want to impress *(ha)* your audience you will really want to check out this repository.

To get the most out of impress you will want to have some experience with CSS and HTML. There are a handful of examples you can sift through and a couple of example repo's that serve as basic templates for creating a snazzy looking slide deck.

Take a look at the introduction example for impress [here](http://impress.github.io/impress.js/#/bored) *(use Chrome)*.

The source code for the example is available on the main GitHub repository which you can fork and edit to get started.

I'm already busy hacking away with impress for some upcoming presentations. Hopefully, you find this as cool as I did.
