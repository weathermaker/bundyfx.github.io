Happy Holidays to everyone!

I am about to board my plane back to Australia to see my family and friends over Christmas and the new year!

Before I head off I wanted to share a quick four part video tutorial I have put together for working with NodeJS and the Express web framework.

You can catch the tutorial over on my YouTube page along with a whole lot more content.

Please let me know if it was helpful in any way. I look forward to making more short series based on feedback from you guys so please let me know what you're interested in.

Happy new year!
