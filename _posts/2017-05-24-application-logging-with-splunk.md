In today's clip we discuss Application logging with Splunk.

I want to go through a basic example of how to get your application up and logging into Splunk to get the most information as possible out of your application.

Splunk offers many simple ways to get started, be sure to check out the Splunk Enterprise Container on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk/).

If you have any questions or comments regarding logging with Splunk please feel free to get in touch!
