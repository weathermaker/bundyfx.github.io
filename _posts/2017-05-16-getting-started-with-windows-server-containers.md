I recently finished up my conference sessions in Germany for the PowerShell Conference.
My two talks were on Windows Server Containers and also on Using PowerShell DSC in Production Cloud based environments.

You can find my talk on Windows Server Containers [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG04oLqKnnU).
I will post the link for my DSC related talk when it's up on the YouTube channel!

As always i'll be planning to make more video related content on my own YouTube channel over the coming weeks.
