In this week's clip we go through AWS EC2 Elastic Container Service and how to get the most out of the ECS CLI.

The ECS CLI eases up the cluster setup process, enables users to run their applications locally or on ECS using the same Docker Compose file format and familiar Compose commands.

Be sure to check out more about the CLI over [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/).

and of course you can find it on Github [here](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli)
