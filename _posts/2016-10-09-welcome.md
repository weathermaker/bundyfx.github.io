## Welcome!

I've had a drink of the Jekyll *kool aid* and I'm sold! I'm looking forward to making more detailed blog posts that dive into cutting edge technologies that fuel DevOps practices.

For more information on setting up your own Jekyll based blog see this awesome walk-through by Pat Hermens [here](https://hermens.com.au/2016/10/01/Getting-started-with-Jekyll-Part-1/).

If you're after any content from my old WordPress blog it can still be found [here](https://flynnbundy.wordpress.com/).
